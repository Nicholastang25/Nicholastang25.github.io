    <p>
        My name is Nicholas Tang, and I am a senior at Hunter College where I major in computer science. 
        I was originally a biology major, till I decided to switch my major 3 semesters in. I like to play 
        video games during my free time as well as reading manga. I would like to learn how to crochet as 
        well as to improve my skills in computer science.
